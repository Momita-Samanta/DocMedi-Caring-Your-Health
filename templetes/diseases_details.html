        Tuberculosis, or TB, is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The bacteria spreads through the air from person to person and mainly attacks the lungs, but it can affect other areas of the body, according to the American Lung Association. 

The disease has been around for most of human history, becoming particularly deadly at times. In fact, researchers can trace tuberculosis back to early Egypt, more than 5,000 years ago. There is also mention of TB in the biblical books of Deuteronomy and Leviticus under the Hebrew word schachepheth, and Hippocrates describes it in his writings as "phthisis."

It’s possible that M. tuberculosis could have killed more people than any other microorganism. Tuberculosis was an epidemic in industrialized Europe and North America during the 18th and 19th centuries. During those times it was known as "consumption." 

The development in the 1940s of streptomycin, the first antibiotic to effectively cure TB, dramatically lowered the number of cases of tuberculosis seen in developed countries, including the United States.

        The majority of people exposed to the bacteria don’t experience tuberculosis symptoms right away. Instead, the infection may go through three stages: <br>
        <br>
        <strong> 1. Primary TB Infection:</strong> This is when the bacteria first enters your body. In many people this causes no symptoms, but others may experience fever or pulmonary symptoms. Most people with a healthy immune system will not develop any symptoms of infection, but in some people the bacteria may grow and develop into an active disease. Most primary TB infections are asymptomatic and followed by a latent TB infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).<br>
        <br>
        <strong> 2. Latent TB Infection:</strong>The bacteria is in your body and can be found through tests, but is not active. During this stage you don’t experience symptoms and can’t spread the disease to others.<br>
        <br>
        <strong> 3. Active Diseases:</strong>The TB bacteria are active and multiplying. You’ll feel sick and will be contagious. It’s important to seek immediate treatment to avoid complications and infecting others. <br>

       <strong> The symptoms of active tuberculosis include:</strong>
       <ul class="flex flex-column a">
